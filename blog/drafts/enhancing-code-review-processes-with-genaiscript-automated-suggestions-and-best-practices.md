In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, maintaining an efficient code review process is paramount. Leveraging GenAIScript can significantly enhance this procedure by automating suggestions and enforcing best practices. In this blog post, we'll dive into how to write a GenAIScript that aids in analyzing Markdown documents in a code repository to ensure descriptions are up-to-date.

### Defining the Files to Analyze

The first line of our GenAIScript specifies which files should be considered for analysis:

```javascript
def("DOCS", env.files, { endsWith: ".md", maxTokens: 2000 })
```

Here, we define a collection named `DOCS` that includes files fetched from `env.files`. The criteria for selection are files that end with the `.md` extension and have a maximum of 2000 tokens. This ensures that the script focuses only on Markdown files and avoids processing excessively large files, which could be time-consuming.

### Analyzing Content for Outdated Descriptions

The next step in our script is to analyze the content of these Markdown files:

```javascript
$`Check if the 'description' field in the front matter in DOCS is outdated.`
```

This command uses a template string to perform a specific check: it looks into the front matter of each file in the `DOCS` collection to see if the `description` field is outdated. The exact mechanism of determining "outdatedness" would typically rely on some form of semantic analysis or timestamp comparison, which might be set up in the broader GenAIScript environment.

### Generating Diagnostics for Outdated Descriptions

Finally, we aim to notify developers of any issues found during the analysis:

```javascript
$`Generate an error for each outdated description.`
```

This command again utilizes a template string to instruct GenAIScript to generate an error for every instance of an outdated description detected in the previous step. This would help developers quickly identify and update parts of documents that might mislead or provide incorrect information to readers.

### Conclusion

By automating parts of the code review process, GenAIScript not only speeds up the review cycle but also helps maintain high standards of accuracy and relevancy in documentation. Scripts like the one we've described can be tailored and expanded, making them a versatile tool in a developer's arsenal.
